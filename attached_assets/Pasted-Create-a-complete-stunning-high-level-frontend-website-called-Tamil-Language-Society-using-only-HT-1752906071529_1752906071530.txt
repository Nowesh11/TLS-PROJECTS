Stylish section/card for society history (add only a visually appealing placeholder or lorem ipsum; I'll fill in content later).

Highlight Tamil culture visually.

Grid or carousel format, with smooth scroll/animations.

Use sample/placeholder ebook entries.

Books Selling:

Fancy hover/press animation for buttons.

Notifications:

Dedicated page with sample notification cards.

Users can view all notifications on the site (dummy/demo data).

Include stylish notification bell icon in navbar with a red dot for new notifications.

(Simulate email notifications: when a new notification is created or marked, show a popup/toast or overlay that mimics an email alert notification to the user, but do not implement real email sending).

Login & Sign Up:

Stunning login and signup forms with floating labels and animated/fancy inputs.

Add “Forgot Password?” link in Login form.

Forgot/Reset Password:

When “Forgot Password?” is clicked, show a form for user email with a fake “reset” flow (front-end only, no backend).

Simulate success message on reset request (“Instructions have been sent to your email”).

Additional Details:

All admin/user content updates should be simulated via UI only (no backend, just dummy content and forms).

Use meaningful placeholder images and text for demo (no references to actual data).

Animations, gradients, and hover effects must be prominent in cards and buttons to achieve a high-level look.

All UI elements (cards, forms, nav, notifications, modals, etc.) must be built only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and be easily customizable.

Ensure every page and feature is accessible by clicking/scrolling from the navbar.

Add clear code comments for easy editing.

The project should be in a well-structured, maintainable format with separated CSS, JS, and HTML files for each page/feature as needed.

Summary:
Build a visually striking, modern, and fully responsive multipage website called Tamil Language Society in blue and white theme (with fun accents if desired), featuring all sections described above, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—with a special notifications page, simulated email/website notifications, and a fake forgot/reset password flow.

No backend, no frameworks, no database.
