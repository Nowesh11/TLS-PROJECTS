## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The website follows a traditional multi-page application (MPA) structure with static HTML pages. Each page is self-contained with shared navigation and styling components. The architecture prioritizes simplicity and maintainability while delivering a premium user experience.

**Design Principles:**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS-based animations and interactions
- Modular JavaScript components

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility considerations
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom properties, flexbox, and grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side functionality and interactions
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins (primary) and Noto Sans Tamil (Tamil script)
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Key Components

### Page Structure
The website consists of 11 main pages:
- **index.html**: Homepage with hero section and features
- **about.html**: Society information and history
- **projects.html**: Community projects showcase

### CSS Architecture
The styling is organized into three main files:
- **style.css**: Core styles, variables, and base components
- **responsive.css**: Media queries and responsive behavior

**Key Features:**
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### JavaScript Modules
- **main.js**: Core functionality, navigation, and page interactions
- **auth.js**: Authentication management and user sessions
- **notifications.js**: Notification system and user alerts

## Data Flow

### Client-Side State Management
Since this is a frontend-only application, all data is managed through:
- **Local Storage**: User preferences, session data, and cached content
- **Session Storage**: Temporary data and form states
- **In-Memory State**: Active user sessions and dynamic content

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login/signup forms
2. Client-side validation and formatting
3. Simulated authentication (stored in localStorage)
4. Session management with timeout handling
5. Role-based navigation updates

### Notification System
1. Periodic check for new notifications
2. Local storage for persistent notifications
3. Real-time badge updates
4. Email simulation for important alerts

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins and Noto Sans Tamil font families
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library via CDN
- **No backend services**: All functionality is client-side

### Font Integration
- Primary typography uses Poppins for modern, clean appearance
- Tamil content uses Noto Sans Tamil for proper script rendering
- Font loading optimization with display=swap

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
The website is designed for static hosting platforms:
- **File Structure**: All assets are relative-path referenced
- **No Build Process**: Direct deployment of source files
- **CDN Ready**: External dependencies loaded from CDNs
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and caching

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Scalability Considerations
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new pages and features
- **Component Reusability**: Shared navigation and styling
- **Performance**: Lightweight with minimal dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

The website provides a solid foundation for a Tamil Language Society's online presence, with room for future backend integration if needed. The current architecture supports all planned features while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.
